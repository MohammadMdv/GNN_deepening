## Requirements
#### Installation with Conda
```bash
conda create -n deep_gcn_benchmark
conda activate deep_gcn_benchmark
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

#### Our Installation Notes for PyTorch Geometric.

What env configs that we tried that have succeeded: Mac/Linux + cuda driver 11.2 + Torch with cuda 11.1 + torch_geometric/torch sparse/etc with cuda 11.1.

What env configs that we tried but didn't work: Linux+Cuda 11.1/11.0/10.2 + whatever version of Torch.

In the above case when it did work, we adopted the following installation commands, and it automatically downloaded built wheels, and the installation completes within seconds.

In the case when it did not work, the installation appears to be very slow (ten minutes level for torch sparse/torch scatter). Then the installation did not produce any error, while when import torch_geometric in python code, it reports errors of different types.

Installation codes that we adopted on Linux cuda 11.2 that did work:

```bash
pip3 install torch==1.9.0+cu111 torchvision==0.10.0+cu111 torchaudio==0.9.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install torch-scatter -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.9.0+cu111.html
pip install torch-sparse -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.9.0+cu111.html
pip install torch-geometric
```

## How to Use the Benchmark

#### Train Deep GCN models as your baselines

To train a deep GCN model `<model>` on dataset `<dataset>` as your baseline, just run main.py and select the model and dataset you want to train
```bash
# <model>   in  [APPNP, DAGNN, GAT, GCN, GCNII, GPRGNN, JKNet, SGC, GRAND]
# <dataset> in  [Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, ogbn-arixv, CoauthorCS, CoauthorPhysics, AmazonComputers, AmazonPhoto, TEXAS, WISCONSIN, CORNELL, ACTOR]
```

we comprehensively explored the optimal hyperparameters for all models we implemented and trained the models under the
well-studied hyperparameter settings. For model-specific hyperparameter configs, please refer to `options/configs/*.yml`

#### Explore different trick combinations

To explore different trick combinations, we provide a `tricks_comb` model, which integrates different types of tricks as
follows:

```
dropouts:        DropEdge, DropNode, FastGCN, LADIES
norms:           BatchNorm, PairNorm, NodeNorm, MeanNorm, GroupNorm, CombNorm
skipConnections: Residual, Initial, Jumping, Dense
others:          IdentityMapping
```

To train a `tricks_comb` model with specific tricks, run:

```bash
python main.py --compare_model=0 --cuda_num=0 --type_trick=<trick_1>+<trick_2>+...+<trick_n> --dataset=<dataset>
```

, where you can assign `type_trick` with any number of tricks. For instance, to train a `trick_comb` model
with `Initial`, `EdgeDrop`, `BatchNorm`, and `IdentityMapping` on Cora, run:

```bash
python main.py --compare_model=0 --cuda_num=0 --type_trick=Initial+EdgeDrop+BatchNorm+IdentityMapping --dataset=Cora
```

We provide two backbones `--type_model=GCN` and `--type_tricks=SGC` for trick combinations. Specifically,
when `--type_model=SGC` and `--type_trick=IdenityMapping` co-occur, `IdentityMapping` has higher priority.

## How to Contribute
You are welcome to make any type of contribution. Here we provide brief guidance to add your own deep GCN models and tricks.

#### Add your own model
Several simple steps to add your own deep GCN model `<DeepGCN>`.

1. Create a Python file named `<DeepGCN>.py`
2. Implement your own model as a `torch.nn.Module`, where the class name is recommended to be consistent with your filename `<DeepGCN>`
3. Make sure the commonly-used hyperparameters are consistent with ours (listed as follows). To create any new hyperparameter, add it in `options/base_options.py`.
```
 --dim_hidden        # hidden dimension
 --num_layers        # number of GCN layers
 --dropout           # rate of dropout for GCN layers
 --lr:               # learning rate
 --weight_decay      # rate of l2 regularization
```
4. Register your model in `models/__init__.py` by adding the following codes:
```python
from <DeepGCN> import <DeepGCN>
__all__.append('<DeepGCN>')
```
5. You are recommended to use `YAML` to store your dataset-specific hyperparameter configuration. Create a `YAML` file `<DeepGCN>.yml` in `options/configs` and add the hyperparameters as the following style:
```yaml
<dataset_1>
  <hyperparameter_1> : value_1
  <hyperparameter_2> : value_2
```
Now your own model `<DeepGCN>` should be added successfully into our benchmark framework. To test the performance of `<DeepGCN>` on `<dataset>`, run:
```bash
python main.py --compare_model=1 --type_model=<DeepGCN> --dataset=<dataset>
```


#### Add your own trick
As all implemented tricks are coupled in `tricks_comb.py` tightly, we do not recommend integrating your own trick to `trick_comb` to avoid unexpected errors. However, you can use the interfaces we provided in `tricks/tricks/` to combine your own trick with ours.
